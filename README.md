## 🕷️ Scraping System
The scraper is designed to be **robust and self-healing**:
*   **`robust_scrape.py`**: Runs scrapers sequentially (AllEvents -> Meetup -> CTC -> Eventbrite).
*   **Business Filter**: A global strict filter ensures zero "junk" events enter the DB.
*   **Source Mapping**: Intellegently maps "Trade Centre" and "AllEvents" to unified backend sources.
