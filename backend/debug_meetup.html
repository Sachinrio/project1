Deterministic data pipelines end in human interpretation. Even with accurate numbers, decisions become slow, biased, non-reproducible, and impossible to replay or audit.\n2. Batch-oriented analytics stacks cannot keep up with shrinking decision windows. Faster refresh rates hide architectural latency instead of removing it.\n3. Decision logic is fragmented across SQL, dashboards, application code, and people. There is no single executable, versioned, or observable decision path.\n4. Decisions are delayed by reviews and meetings, turning data-driven organizations into reactionary systems that act only after value is already lost.\n5. Accountability is diffused. When outcomes fail, organizations cannot clearly trace who decided, why it was decided, or which alternative was ignored.\n\n**What will be Dealt in this Meetup**\n\n1. Why the **BI → dashboard → human review** pipeline is an architectural anti-pattern in low-latency, high-autonomy systems.\n2. How decision latency is unintentionally introduced by **batch semantics, snapshot queries, and pull-based analytics interfaces**.\n3. Where decision logic actually lives today—**SQL CTEs, LookML/YAML, alert configs, application code, and tribal knowledge**—and why this makes decisions non-replayable.\n4. Why embedding LLMs directly into analytics workflows breaks **determinism, reproducibility, and numeric trust**, even when the data layer is correct.\n5. How “human-in-the-loop” becomes a **single point of failure** once systems cross real-time operational thresholds.\n6. Why observability stops at pipelines and infrastructure, but **never reaches decision execution paths**.\n\n**What You will Learn**\n\n1. How to think about **decisions as executable system artifacts**, not emergent behavior from dashboards and meetings.\n2. How to distinguish **data correctness, metric correctness, and decision correctness**—and why most stacks only solve the first.\n3. How modern enterprises are unintentionally running **non-deterministic decision systems on deterministic data platforms**.\n4. How to evaluate analytics and AI platforms using **decision latency, replayability, and auditability** instead of visualization depth.\n5. How to reason about **agentic systems without surrendering numeric authority to LLMs**.\n6. How to identify where your current stack leaks **latency, ownership, and accountability**—before scaling makes it irreversible.\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nAzure Data warehouses, streaming pipelines, BI tools, semantic layers, alerting systems, LLM copilots, and human approvals stitched together, optimized for reporting accuracy, not timely, auditable decisions.\n\n**Who Should Attend**\n\nArchitects, data leaders, product builders, founders, and anyone responsible for decisions made through dashboards, reports, or KPI reviews.","startDate":"2026-03-07T04:30:00.000Z","endDate":"","eventStatus":"https://schema.org/EventScheduled","image":"/images/fallbacks/redesign/group-cover-5-square.webp","eventAttendanceMode":"https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","location":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"","addressRegion":"","addressCountry":""}},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Microsoft Azure User Group - Chennai","url":"https://www.meetup.com/chennai-microsoft-azure-user-group/"},"performer":"Microsoft Azure User Group - Chennai"},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"AgentCamp Global AI Bootcamp 2026 - Chennai","url":"https://www.meetup.com/global-ai-community-chennai/events/312990230/","description":"**🎊 AgentCamp 2026 – Chennai**\n\nA Festival of AI, Innovation & Community\n\n🌟 **Step into the carnival of intelligence!** AgentCamp isn’t just another tech meetup — it’s a **celebration of AI** where developers, creators, and enthusiasts gather under one roof to explore the magic of **AI agents, groundbreaking tools, and real-world solutions**.\n\n🎶 Imagine the energy of a festival:\n\n* 🎤 Inspiring **keynotes & lightning talks**\n* 🛠️ Hands-on **workshops**\n* 🤝 Vibrant **networking zones**\n* 🏆 Recognition of **community champions**\n* 🎨 Creative showcases of **AI-powered innovation**\n\n💡 Our goal is simple: to **learn together, share openly, and build inclusively** — making AI accessible to everyone, everywhere.\n\n✨ Stay tuned for dazzling updates on **venue, speakers, and special sessions** — because this isn’t just an event, it’s an **AI festival experience** you won’t want to miss!","startDate":"2026-02-21T03:00:00.000Z","endDate":"","eventStatus":"https://schema.org/EventScheduled","image":"/images/fallbacks/redesign/group-cover-5-square.webp","eventAttendanceMode":"https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","location":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"","addressRegion":"","addressCountry":""}},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Global AI  Chennai","url":"https://www.meetup.com/global-ai-community-chennai/"},"performer":"Global AI  Chennai"},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Global Power Platform & Agent Bootcamp 2026 Tamil Nadu","url":"https://www.meetup.com/tn-bizapps-copilot/events/313146000/","description":"We’re announcing the Global Power Platform & Agent Bootcamp 2026 in Chennai!

We couldn’t reproduce it. We fixed what we think was the issue.”***\n\n**🎟️** ***Please RSVP [here](https://sahaj.ai/events/from-chaos-to-control-reproducible-failure-testing-in-microservices/) to join-in for this conversation in-person.***\n\n(Note: To ensure a spot, please register through the link)\nThis line captures a hard truth of microservices: the most serious failures rarely come from obvious bugs. They emerge from subtle interactions between timing, retries, partial failures, and networks. These incidents are rare, fleeting, and often disappear when we try to observe them. In distributed systems, they’re called ***Heisenbugs*** not because they’re imaginary, but because they resist repeatable observation.\n\nMicroservices inherit this failure profile even when individual services are simple and well-tested. As systems become more asynchronous and failure-aware, the space of possible behaviors explodes. Chaos engineering encourages us to inject failures and observe outcomes, but chaos is inherently non-deterministic. When something breaks, we usually can’t replay the exact sequence that caused it — leaving teams to reason probabilistically and ship fixes with limited confidence.\n\nThis talk doesn’t introduce a new framework or silver bullet. Instead, it introduces an idea: applying deterministic simulation techniques from distributed systems research to microservices. Through a small simulation, we’ll explore what changes when we can control time, message ordering, retries, and failures — and replay the same incident until we truly understand it.\n\nThe goal isn’t to replace chaos, but to complement it. By making rare failures reproducible, deterministic simulation changes how we debug systems, reason about correctness, and validate fixes. Attendees will leave with a mental model and design questions that influence how microservices are tested, evolved, and trusted in the real world.","startDate":"2026-02-18T12:45:00.000Z","endDate":"","eventStatus":"https://schema.org/EventScheduled","image":"/images/fallbacks/redesign/group-cover-5-square.webp","eventAttendanceMode":"https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","location":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"","addressRegion":"","addressCountry":""}},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"DEVDAY

Valley Techniques to Scale Fast","dateTime":"2026-02-14T11:00:00+04:00","description":"**Most startups don’t fail because they run out of money.**\n**They fail because they scale the wrong thing — too fast.**\n​This workshop is designed for founders who want to scale aggressively without gambling their runway.\n​To keep this **deeply practical and interactive**, participation is **intentionally limited**. This is not a webinar. It’s a working session where founders get direct exposure to proven product discovery and scaling frameworks — the kind that prevent costly pivots and wasted execution.\n\n​The session is led by **Arshad Sayyad**, a **3-time founder** who has:\n\n* ​Raised capital and built successful startups\n* ​Scaled products and teams across the **US and Asia**\n* ​Led large-scale transformations in both **startup and enterprise environments**\n\n​This is for founders who value speed with clarity, not guesswork.\n​Seats are limited by design.\n\n​If you’re building (or about to build) a product and asking:\n\n* ​*Are we solving the right problem?*\n* ​*Is this market big and real — or just loud?*\n* ​*Why are users not converting, retaining, or paying?*\n* ​*How do we scale without constant rework and firefighting?*\n\n​you’re in the right place.\n\n***\n\n## ​🚀 What This Event Is About\n\n​This is a practical, founder-only workshop community focused on scaling with clarity, not guesswork.\n​We break down **how fast-scaling startups actually build products**, using:\n\n* ​**Market feasibility analysis** (before you burn time \u0026 money)\n* ​**Product discovery frameworks** used by high-growth teams\n* ​**User research techniques** like **Kano, MoSCoW, Jobs-to-be-Done**\n* ​**Agile product management** that supports scale (not chaos)\n* ​**Agile product discovery** to reduce risk *before* you build\n\n​No theory. No buzzwords.\nEverything is designed to help you move faster with fewer mistakes.\n\n***\n\n## ​**HOST**\n\n## **Arshad Sayyad is a technologist, entrepreneur, and operator with experience across three startups, global enterprises, and private equity–backed environments. He has led and scaled organizations from early-stage to 25,000+ people, with leadership roles at Accenture and Fidelity, and is currently Co-founder \u0026 CBO at StackGen. He brings a practical, human-first approach to helping founders scale with clarity and sound judgment.[www.linkedin.com/in/arshadsayyad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshadsayyad) \\| [www.seranai.com](https://www.seranai.com/) \\| [www.arshadsayyad.com](https://www.arshadsayyad.com/)**\n\n## **🎯** **Who This Is For**\n\n​✔ Founders \u0026 co-founders\n✔ Early to growth-stage startups\n✔ Scale-ups preparing for aggressive growth\n✔ Product-led founders tired of rework and pivots\n​❌ Not for idea tourists or passive learners\n❌ Not for people looking for generic startup advice\n\n***\n\n## ​💡 What You’ll Walk Away With\n\n* ​A **clear product discovery playbook** you can apply immediately\n* ​**45 Minute 1:1 Startup Business Review with Arshad Sayyad ( AMA Session)**\n* ​Confidence in *what to build next* — and what **not** to build\n* ​A structured way to validate markets, users, and features\n* ​Fewer pivots, faster decisions, stronger execution\n* ​A founder mindset that scales **before** the org does\n\n***\n\n## ​🌍 Format\n\n* ​**Remote, live workshops**\n* ​Interactive, founder-to-founder discussions\n* ​Real startup examples, not case-study theater\n* ​Built for busy founders who value **speed and signal**\n\n***\n\n​**Scaling fast isn’t about moving blindly.**\n**It’s about learning faster than everyone else.**","aeoDescription":null,"eventType":"ONLINE","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-pehahhcg/events/312781903/","isAttending":false,"isSaved":false,"maxTickets":160,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN","featuredEventPhoto":{"__ref":"PhotoInfo:532534534"},"feeSettings":null,"group":{"__ref":"Group:38327096"},"socialProofInsights":null,"rsvps":{"__typename":"RsvpConnection","totalCount":160,"edges":[{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":true,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478055102"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:194597746"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478348235"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:76594642"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:225151588"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478561269"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478544285"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:354384520"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478632291"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:275197756"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478520088"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:476591962"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:469759872"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478718475"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:476446604"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478736010"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478611457"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:336350766"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:287134286"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478656898"}}}]},"series":null,"venue":{"__typename":"Venue","name":"Online

Industry","dateTime":"2026-03-07T10:00:00+05:30","description":"Modern enterprises are not failing because of bad data.\nThey are failing because **decisions still wait for dashboards and humans**.\n\nThis meetup examines the **structural cracks**—technical and business—that are quietly limiting how fast and safely organizations can act.\n\n**Pain Points**\n\n1. Deterministic data pipelines end in human interpretation. Even with accurate numbers, decisions become slow, biased, non-reproducible, and impossible to replay or audit.\n2. Batch-oriented analytics stacks cannot keep up with shrinking decision windows. Faster refresh rates hide architectural latency instead of removing it.\n3. Decision logic is fragmented across SQL, dashboards, application code, and people. There is no single executable, versioned, or observable decision path.\n4. Decisions are delayed by reviews and meetings, turning data-driven organizations into reactionary systems that act only after value is already lost.\n5. Accountability is diffused. When outcomes fail, organizations cannot clearly trace who decided, why it was decided, or which alternative was ignored.\n\n**What will be Dealt in this Meetup**\n\n1. Why the **BI → dashboard → human review** pipeline is an architectural anti-pattern in low-latency, high-autonomy systems.\n2. How decision latency is unintentionally introduced by **batch semantics, snapshot queries, and pull-based analytics interfaces**.\n3. Where decision logic actually lives today—**SQL CTEs, LookML/YAML, alert configs, application code, and tribal knowledge**—and why this makes decisions non-replayable.\n4. Why embedding LLMs directly into analytics workflows breaks **determinism, reproducibility, and numeric trust**, even when the data layer is correct.\n5. How “human-in-the-loop” becomes a **single point of failure** once systems cross real-time operational thresholds.\n6. Why observability stops at pipelines and infrastructure, but **never reaches decision execution paths**.\n\n**What You will Learn**\n\n1. How to think about **decisions as executable system artifacts**, not emergent behavior from dashboards and meetings.\n2. How to distinguish **data correctness, metric correctness, and decision correctness**—and why most stacks only solve the first.\n3. How modern enterprises are unintentionally running **non-deterministic decision systems on deterministic data platforms**.\n4. How to evaluate analytics and AI platforms using **decision latency, replayability, and auditability** instead of visualization depth.\n5. How to reason about **agentic systems without surrendering numeric authority to LLMs**.\n6. How to identify where your current stack leaks **latency, ownership, and accountability**—before scaling makes it irreversible.\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nAzure Data warehouses, streaming pipelines, BI tools, semantic layers, alerting systems, LLM copilots, and human approvals stitched together, optimized for reporting accuracy, not timely, auditable decisions.\n\n**Who Should Attend**\n\nArchitects, data leaders, product builders, founders, and anyone responsible for decisions made through dashboards, reports, or KPI reviews.","aeoDescription":null,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/chennai-microsoft-azure-user-group/events/313264665/","isAttending":false,"isSaved":false,"maxTickets":0,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN","featuredEventPhoto":null,"feeSettings":null,"group":{"__ref":"Group:18853977"},"socialProofInsights":null,"rsvps":{"__typename":"RsvpConnection","totalCount":43,"edges":[{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":true,"member":{"__ref":"Member:214670557"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":true,"member":{"__ref":"Member:218840597"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":true,"member":{"__ref":"Member:253319223"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:411288493"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:225200673"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:423236044"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:477763551"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:426118255"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:476225362"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:14074724"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:474289937"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:365825426"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:474485778"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:474434772"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:423537208"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:425131799"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:467864198"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:456405423"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:290132061"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:456662257"}}}]},"series":null,"venue":null},"RecommendedEventsEdge:{\"node\":{\"id\":\"313264665\"}}":{"__typename":"RecommendedEventsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Event:313264665","id":"313264665"},"metadata":{"__typename":"SearchMetadata","recId":"f0d48088-988d-4852-b22b-dc0b32b3fae2","recSource":"ml-popular-events-nearby-offline"}},"PhotoInfo:532364074":{"__typename":"PhotoInfo","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/2/a/highres_532364074.jpeg","id":"532364074"},"PhotoInfo:530965739":{"__typename":"PhotoInfo","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/4/8/b/highres_530965739.jpeg","id":"530965739"},"Group:37837047":{"__typename":"Group","id":"37837047","name":"Global

We couldn’t reproduce it. We fixed what we think was the issue.”***\n\n**🎟️** ***Please RSVP [here](https://sahaj.ai/events/from-chaos-to-control-reproducible-failure-testing-in-microservices/) to join-in for this conversation in-person.***\n\n(Note: To ensure a spot, please register through the link)\nThis line captures a hard truth of microservices: the most serious failures rarely come from obvious bugs. They emerge from subtle interactions between timing, retries, partial failures, and networks. These incidents are rare, fleeting, and often disappear when we try to observe them. In distributed systems, they’re called ***Heisenbugs*** not because they’re imaginary, but because they resist repeatable observation.\n\nMicroservices inherit this failure profile even when individual services are simple and well-tested. As systems become more asynchronous and failure-aware, the space of possible behaviors explodes. Chaos engineering encourages us to inject failures and observe outcomes, but chaos is inherently non-deterministic. When something breaks, we usually can’t replay the exact sequence that caused it — leaving teams to reason probabilistically and ship fixes with limited confidence.\n\nThis talk doesn’t introduce a new framework or silver bullet. Instead, it introduces an idea: applying deterministic simulation techniques from distributed systems research to microservices. Through a small simulation, we’ll explore what changes when we can control time, message ordering, retries, and failures — and replay the same incident until we truly understand it.\n\nThe goal isn’t to replace chaos, but to complement it. By making rare failures reproducible, deterministic simulation changes how we debug systems, reason about correctness, and validate fixes. Attendees will leave with a mental model and design questions that influence how microservices are tested, evolved, and trusted in the real world.","aeoDescription":null,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/devday_chennai/events/313203783/","isAttending":false,"isSaved":false,"maxTickets":0,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN","featuredEventPhoto":{"__ref":"PhotoInfo:532582916"},"feeSettings":null,"group":{"__ref":"Group:20225261"},"socialProofInsights":null,"rsvps":{"__typename":"RsvpConnection","totalCount":14,"edges":[{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":true,"member":{"__ref":"Member:427046587"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:430917664"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:425131799"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:427471566"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:369873250"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:283356810"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:295967570"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:422749778"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:310753292"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:455354813"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:465048124"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:468066446"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:478254486"}}},{"__typename":"RsvpEdge","node":{"__typename":"Rsvp","isHost":false,"member":{"__ref":"Member:469112159"}}}]},"series":null,"venue":{"__typename":"Venue","name":"Sahaj Software","address":"Type 2/15, Rajiv Gandhi IT Expy, Phase 1, Vikram Sarabhai Instronics Estate, Thiruvanmiyur","city":"Chennai","state":"","country":"in"}},"RecommendedEventsEdge:{\"node\":{\"id\":\"313203783\"}}":{"__typename":"RecommendedEventsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Event:313203783","id":"313203783"},"metadata":{"__typename":"SearchMetadata","recId":"f0d48088-988d-4852-b22b-dc0b32b3fae2","recSource":"ml-popular-events-nearby-offline"}}},"_sentryTraceData":"a67a35ec6c27442cca3a50004f5781d2-28a24033d94cad76-0","_sentryBaggage":"sentry-environment=production,sentry-release=e0e219b2146dbf53f9231e6a269a5b1ccddf236b,sentry-public_key=5d12cd2317664353456ab4c40d079af2,sentry-trace_id=a67a35ec6c27442cca3a50004f5781d2,sentry-org_id=6787,sentry-sampled=false,sentry-sample_rand=0.8144872588740089,sentry-sample_rate=0.1"},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/find","query":{"location":"in--Chennai","source":"EVENTS","categoryId":"career-business"},"buildId":"e0e219b2146dbf53f9231e6a269a5b1ccddf236b","isFallback":false,"isExperimentalCompile":false,"gssp":true,"locale":"en-US","locales":["en-US","en-AU","de","de-DE","es","es-ES","fr","fr-FR","it","it-IT","ja","ja-JP","ko","ko-KR","nl","nl-NL","pl","pl-PL","pt","pt-BR","ru","ru-RU","tr","tr-TR","th-TH"],"defaultLocale":"en-US","scriptLoader":[]}</script><script id="facebook-pixel" data-nscript="afterInteractive">
